# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_of_Zomato
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in any data analysis process. In this project, I perform EDA on the Zomato dataset, which contains information about restaurants in various cities across multiple countries. The dataset includes variables such as restaurant names, addresses, ratings, cuisines, and prices.

Using Python and several data analysis libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, I explore the data, visualize the distributions and relationships between variables, and gain insights into the characteristics of restaurants across different cities and countries. I also conduct statistical tests to validate any observations and hypotheses.

The objective of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the dataset, such as identifying the most popular cuisines in different cities, the relationship between the rating and price of a restaurant, and the overall quality of restaurants in different countries.

The code and findings are presented in a Jupyter Notebook and shared on GitHub for others to replicate and build upon.
